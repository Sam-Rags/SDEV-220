Description: Module 3.1 - 3.6 from the text book Introducing Python 2nd edition
In this program I demonstrate the use of variables and math functions
native to Python. Starting with calculating the number of seconds in
an hour, assigning that number to a variable and using that variable
to work out how many seconds in a day (also in a variable). Finally,
using division to determine how many hours in a day using floating point 
and integer division.
